## Testing SpineML / Python / ROS integration
### Native install
1. Copy the contents of the `examples/bindings` folder from the MammalBot download to your Namespace root folder - by default this is `/usr/local/SystemML/Namespace`
2. Open SpineCreator and load the `bindings_examples.proj` model. You should see a very simple model with two single neurons and nothing else
3. To run the model:
	* Open a terminal and run `roscore` to start the ROS core 
	* Open a second terminal window and navigate to the `examples/projects/bindings` directory
	* Execute the model with `~/SpineML_2_BRAHMS/convert_script_s2b -m "$PWD" -e 0`
	* If the model has run successfully, the bottom of the output log will look something like:
    ```
    W3    0.928236       FINISHED
    W5    0.930353       FINISHED
    ```
    * To observe the model's output to an example ROS node, run `rostopic echo /example/python` in a third terminal window
    * Execute the model again to see data output to this ROS node
    
### Docker install
(Pending)
`docker-compose run spineml bash`
