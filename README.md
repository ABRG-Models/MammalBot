The MammalBot cognitive architecture is composed of several modular components, each representing a particular brain region and/or function. We use [ROS](https://www.ros.org) to interface with physical and virtual robots, [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org) to simulate virtual robots, and [SpineML](http://spineml.github.io) for most model descriptions. Thus, there are some prerequisites for using or developing MammalBot:

## Software requirements
MammalBot is being developed with the [MiRo](https://www.miro-e.com) robot as a principal testbed, so you will currently need access to either a virtual or physical MiRo to develop or use MammalBot. Assuming you don't have access to a physical robot, this means you will need:
* Gazebo 7 for simulating a virtual MiRo robot, which requires
* ROS Kinetic, the latest ROS version compatible with Gazebo 7, which requires
* [Ubuntu 16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/) (or an Ubuntu 16-based fork such as [Linux Mint 18.3](https://linuxmint.com/release.php?id=31)), the latest Ubuntu release compatible with ROS Kinetic
* You will also need [SpineCreator](https://github.com/SpineML/SpineCreator) and the associated programs [SpineML PreFlight](https://github.com/SpineML/SpineML_PreFlight), [SpineML to BRAHMS](https://github.com/SpineML/SpineML_2_BRAHMS), and the simulation engine [BRAHMS](https://github.com/BRAHMS-SystemML/brahms) to view, edit, and run MammalBot models.

There are two paths to getting set up:

### Docker *(recommended)*
As installing and configuring multiple interreliant software packages can be a time-consuming project in itself, the MammalBot repo includes a Docker Compose file that will launch a prebuilt Docker environment with all the required software preconfigured. This should work on any version of Linux but won't work on Macs, as [xhyve](https://github.com/machyve/xhyve) (on which Docker for Mac is built) [doesn't support GPU passthrough](https://github.com/machyve/xhyve/issues/108) required for Gazebo's 3D rendering.
#### To start
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
2. Clone the MammalBot repository to your machine
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` from the repo directory to download and start all required images. A Gazebo window should appear with a virtual MiRo robot in a walled arena.
	* Gazebo will sometimes quit prematurely due to a [known bug](https://github.com/vvv-school/assignment_computed-torque/issues/3#issuecomment-364370433). If the Gazebo window doesn't appear, run `docker-compose up -d` again
4. Run `docker exec -it mammalbot_spineml ./ros_entrypoint.sh bash` to open a Bash prompt inside the SpineML container. This should look similar to `root@14595b1a7a95:/#`. From here, you can run specific MammalBot experiments (see below).
#### To stop
1. Simply type `exit` within the SpineML container to return to the shell of your host machine.
2. Run `docker-compose stop` to halt all MammalBot containers.
	* You can restart MammalBot later with `docker-compose start`

### Native
If you have an Ubuntu 16.04 install or are able to create one, you may install the required software packages yourself.
1. Follow [these instructions](http://labs.consequentialrobotics.com/miro-e/docs/index.php?page=Developer_Profiles_Simulator) to install ROS, the MiRo MDK, and Gazebo
2. Follow [these instructions](https://spineml.github.io/spinecreator/sourcelin/) to install SpineCreator and associated packages
	* You must set the `-DCOMPILE_PYTHON_BINDING=ON` flag when compiling BRAHMS to enable Python components

## Testing SpineML / Python / ROS integration
### Native install
1. Copy the contents of the `examples/bindings` folder from the MammalBot download to your Namespace root folder - by default this is `/usr/local/SystemML/Namespace`
2. Open SpineCreator and load the `bindings_examples.proj` model. You should see a very simple model with two single neurons and nothing else
3. To run the model:
	* Open a terminal and run `roscore` to start the ROS core 
	* Open a second terminal window and navigate to the `examples/projects/bindings` directory
	* Execute the model with `~/SpineML_2_BRAHMS/convert_script_s2b -m "$PWD" -e 0`
	* If the model has run successfully, the bottom of the output log will look something like:
    ```
    W3    0.928236       FINISHED
    W5    0.930353       FINISHED
    ```
    * To observe the model's output to an example ROS node, run `rostopic echo /example/python` in a third terminal window
    * Execute the model again to see data output to this ROS node
    
### Docker install
(Pending)
`docker-compose run spineml bash`
