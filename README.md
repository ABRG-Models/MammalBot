# MammalBot
Computational models and related work for the MammalBot cognitive architecture.

## Overview
MammalBot is a layered control system architecture modelled on the mammalian brain capable of generating motivated real-time behaviour on a range of different target physical robot platforms. The system is composed of a set of nested sensorimotor loops in which lower loops can function without the help of higher loops, whilst higher loops operate by modulating the behaviour of those lower down.

## Technical integration
To avoid generating onerous constraints on flexible development, MammalBot uses an agile approach based around a preferred set of software tools. This framework, illustrated below, is intended to maximise interoperability between different kinds of models and to minimise the difficulty of deployment on robot hardware. Solid lines indicate native compatibility between
components, and dashed lines indicate where compatibility may be achieved via a conversion tool or wrapper utility.
