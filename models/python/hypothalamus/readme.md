# Motivational system simulator

In this section you can find the code of our Dynamical System approach to motivation. 

## Prerequisites:

- PyQt5


## Running it

cd dynamical
python motivational_agent.py

Once in the GUI, modify the initial food source location as preferred and run the simulation through the "play" button. Details of the model will be published soon.
